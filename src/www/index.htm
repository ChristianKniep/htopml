			<h1>What is Htopml ?</h1>
			<p>Htopml is a light server to instrument programs for debugging and
			to track some values from struct directly in your browser.
			It's main goal is to provide a fast and simple way to export struct
			values via JSon format. By this way, we can quicly build a dynamic
			view in HTML/JS.</p>
			<p>Htopml came by default with hightchart JS library to draw some
			graphics from exported data but it's also possible to draw your
			own SVG file to represent you data model and update values
			directly in it.
			</p>
			<p>Current version is 0.1.0-dev.</p>
